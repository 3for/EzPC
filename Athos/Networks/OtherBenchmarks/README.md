This folder contains TensorFlow code for other benchmarks implemented for CrypTFlow. 
In particular, it contains the following networks:
- *MiniONN on CIFAR*: This is the neural network over the CIFAR-10 dataset used in the MiniONN paper. Implementation is our own, but network description is taken from fig. 13 of [MiniONN paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/452.pdf).

## Setup
Run for example, MiniONN_CIFAR.py as `python3 MiniONN_CIFAR.py`. This will dump the TensorFlow metadata required by Athos for further compilation.
